### App Idea

**App Name**: SkillBridge

**Description**:  
SkillBridge is a networking and collaboration platform built specifically for college students to connect based on skills, interests, and project needs. Whether you're a computer science major looking for a designer, or a biologist who needs a programmer for a research project, SkillBridge makes it easy to match and collaborate.

Users can create profiles highlighting their skills and project ideas, browse potential teammates acros disciplines, chat in real-time, and even tag or endorse each other. The goal is to break silos between departments and help students find the right people to build, research, or innovate together â€” all in one place.

Planned future features include:
- A ranking system for top contributors
- Skill-based project recommendations
- Group chat and collaboration boards
